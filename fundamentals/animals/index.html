<h1>discover island</h1>
<p>Located at the center of the park, this area includes the Tree of Life.<br> There are many trails leading off of the area around the Tree of Life,<br> and these trails lead to different animal enclosures.<br> It really looks like the animals you're seeing are in their natural habitats.<br> Inside the tree of life, there's actually a 3D show called It's Tough to be a Bug.<br> This show is based off of the Pixar movie A Bug's Life, and basically shows you how hard it is being a bug, and that bugs are your friends.<br> It's really cute! At least until ants begin "crawling" across your feet (it's actually just a sensory trick, but it feels real). </p>
